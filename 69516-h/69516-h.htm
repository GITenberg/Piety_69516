<p>Frost tossed an avenil wrapper in the space erviser's part reducer.</p>

<p>"These people have found the secret of immortality," he said.</p>

<p>"What a romantic temperament you have," Scott replied softly. "'The
secret of immortality,' it sounds as dated as the philosopher's stone."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? We're not immortal."</p>

<p>"No, we're not—though you may not have noticed that the last report of
the committee for India gives the life expectancy there now as seventy
years. And because of consistently good medical care, you and I both
look a good ten years younger than our actual chronological age."</p>

<p>Scott was in his early thirties: he had the trim body and resilient
skin of first maturity.</p>

<p>"That's not immortality."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. That's what I'm driving at. How do we arrest aging
and prolong life? With some mysterious serum, by some dark business
with a fantastic ray? Hocus-pocus of a sort which would be the
equivalent of the philosopher's stone I mentioned?</p>

<p>"We've increased our temporal range to the point where it's not
at all unusual to meet active and alert people who've passed the
century mark. Society has done that by a system of care which is
pre-prenatal, by seeing to it that every human being grows up in the
best possible environment and receives the best possible nutrition,
and by prophylactic measures of all possible sorts. In a word, we've
eliminated from human life all the stresses and strains which can be
eliminated. And that's the nearest to immortality we'll ever get."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Frost raised his eyebrows. "You heard what Thor-na'thor said. How do
you account for it?"</p>

<p>Scott went over to the viewing plates and turned them to low power. The
mass of buildings that was Tarthal leaped into visibility. "I don't
account for it," he said, with his back to Frost. "We don't speak his
language very well yet; we may have misunderstood. Or he may have been
speaking metaphorically."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You heard him say, 'And you let him die?' when we were
telling him about Kynaston's burial. That wasn't metaphor. He sounded
deeply and genuinely shocked. In my opinion, Thor-na'thor was shocked
because, here on Vardia, among his own people, no one ever dies."</p>

<p>Scott shrugged and did not answer for a moment. "I might believe," he
went on after a pause, "that they'd worked out therapeutic techniques
which are more successful than ours in prolonging life, if the Vardians
weren't obviously at a low level of scientific progress. Their vehicles
are steam-powered, and they light their buildings with carbon-filament
electric lights. Their young men and women dabble in science, yes, but
for exactly the same reason that they take an interest in music and
painting and the dramatic arts—because it's cultural."</p>

<p>"Got you there!" Frost said in some triumph. He got up and began to
pace the cabin's length. "You're assuming that scientific advances
occur evenly and are distributed, so to speak, on a plane. Didn't you
take any courses in the history of science?</p>

<p>"One of the most striking features of terrestrial science has been
its uneven development. Man knew the diameter of the earth before he
was aware of the circulation of the blood, and it was more than two
hundred years after the laws of moving bodies were formulated before
the science of psychology was born. First the physical sciences, then
biology, and at last sociology and the psychology of the depths.</p>

<p>"What reason is there to think that Thor-na'thor's people haven't
reversed the progression and developed the life sciences first?"</p>

<p>"The order of development on earth wasn't accidental, but dictated by
the nature of things; physics is an easier science than psychology. And
leaving that aside, why is Thor-na'thor so reticent about it, assuming
you're right? You've tried to pump him a dozen times since he made that
remark about Kynaston, and all he does is look embarrassed and change
the subject. Supposing he's understood you, and you him, his attitude
is more appropriate to a religious matter than a scientific one."</p>

<p>"I've got a theory about that." Frost ruffled up his hair. "I suppose
you mean the way he's so careful to keep us away from that building in
the north of the city.</p>

<p>"Would it be the first time a scientific discovery has been taken over
by religion? Remember those steam engines and assorted gadgets the
Alexandrians invented, and how they were used to produce miracles for
the devout? Or there may have been a gradual decadence with religion
moving slowly in on science. That might explain the general quietism in
the atmosphere, though I admit the Vardians don't seem decadent."</p>

<p>"Um."</p>

<p>"You don't believe me?" Frost said.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Nope."</p>

<p>"Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"... Yes."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thor-na'thor was a good dinner guest. He held his liquor well, he
laughed in the places where laughter was appropriate, he even essayed a
mild jest or two of his own. He was genuinely friendly and amiable.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Frost and Scott were not pleased. They were too tense
and excited to enjoy their guest's social qualities, and his ability
to soak up liquor without being affected by it was nothing less than
catastrophic. They were both a good deal drunker than Thor-na'thor was,
and it was not their tongues the evening had been designed to loosen.</p>

<p>Scott twitched an eyelid in signal to Frost. "Got a Venusian liquor,"
the latter said feebly to Thor-na'thor. "Like your opinion on it." He
got a bottle from the buffet.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Thor-na'thor replied, smiling and holding out his glass.
"Delighted, my boy. What generous hosts you terrestrials are!"</p>

<p>"Thanks." With inebriated precision, Frost poured a huge snort of
phyteumah into the Vardian's glass, and portions as much smaller as was
consistent with decency into Scott's and his own.</p>

<p>"I especially appreciate your invitation," Thor-na'thor went on,
sipping at his drink, "since I have been distressed—absurdly, I
suppose, but there it is—over the death a few days ago of a pet of
mine. This evening has been a welcome distraction for me." He sipped
again.</p>

<p>Frost and Scott exchanged quick glances. Was this going to be easier
than they had thought?</p>

<p>"That's too bad," Scott said. "What was it, a dog?"</p>

<p>"An animal very similar to a dog. I had reared Lilil from shortly after
her birth. One grows attached to them."</p>

<p>Still sipping, Thor-na'thor launched on an anecdote designed to
illustrate Lilil's cleverness and quasi-human abilities. It grew into a
biography, and still he sipped phyteumah from his glass. When the glass
was empty, Frost poured more in it unobtrusively while Thor-na'thor
talked on. The glass was refilled twice before the Vardian paused. "I
regret her death," he finished.</p>

<p>Scott decided to plunge. "How fortunate you are spared such losses with
your own people!" he said, tripping over the consonants. "You Vardians
don't die, do you?"</p>

<p>"No." The answer was immediate.</p>

<p>Frost cast a glance of triumph at Scott. The latter scarcely perceived
it; Thor-na'thor's open admission had nonplussed him. He halted and
tried to cudgel his foggy mind into deciding what to say next.</p>

<p>"What is the cause of that?" he got out at last; he had had too much to
drink.</p>

<p>"What boys you terrestrials are!" the Vardian answered, smilingly. He
got to his feet. "Thank you for a delightful evening. Good night." He
halted at the top of the companionway. "I believe we shall have rain
before morning," he said, and was gone.</p>

<p>"The blamed old buzzard!" Scott said. He took a sip of water and
another Sobrior pill. "Leading us on, guzzling our food, guzzling our
drink, and finally laughing at us! He told us that yarn about that dog
of his just so we'd bite and ask him if the Vardians were immortal! The
blamed old ape!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but never mind that," Frost replied. He had taken two Sobrior
pills and was quite himself again. "The important thing is that he
admitted it."</p>

<p>"He only said that to make us look like fools."</p>

<p>"What does he care whether we're fools or not? There's really something
there, or he wouldn't be so coy about it!"</p>

<p>"I'll find out what he's up to if it's the last thing I do!"</p>

<p>"Listen, let's try—"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thor-na'thor said, "Yes, this machine would be most useful to my
people. We have dramatic entertainments, but nothing like that." He
indicated the tiny stereo projector Scott was holding out to him. "We
Vardians are a happy folk, but I believe your machine would make us a
little happier."</p>

<p>"You could make a lot of money with it," Scott said.</p>

<p>Thor-na'thor gave a slight shrug. "Money—that is not so important on
Vardia. But it is true that I should be the object of a great deal of
gratitude from my people if I introduced it to them."</p>

<p>"You'd like that?" Scott asked. "You Vardians value that?"</p>

<p>"We value it greatly. I should like it very much."</p>

<p>"It's yours," Scott said, holding out the stereo projector.</p>

<p>An expression of extreme pleasure came over Thor-na'thor's face. "Thank
you!" he said, extending his hand. "You are very generous."</p>

<p>"If," Scott hurried on, "you'll tell us why the Vardians don't die."</p>

<p>Thor-na'thor pulled his hand back. "I beg your pardon," he said
quietly. "I had thought it was a gift."</p>

<p>Scott's cheeks began to burn. "Oh, heck," he said bruskly, "take the
th—"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Scott," Frost broke in. And then, to Thor-na'thor, "We'll
give it to you, and gladly—and a lot of other stuff, too—if you'll do
what Scott said. How can it hurt you to tell us? Why don't you want us
to know?"</p>

<p>"You are joking. You terrestrials are always joking. There are things
of which one does not speak."</p>

<p>"Then take us to the building we've never been allowed inside."</p>

<p>"You mean the library? No, it would do you no good. I am sorry, my
boy." Thor-na'thor always addressed the two earth-men as "my boy"
though only heaven knew what the temporal relationship between them
was. "It is impossible."</p>

<p>"You can have this too if you'll only tell us the secret," Frost said.
He brought out a power generator, a model of compactness, less than
thirty centimeters on a side, with a sealed-in permanent power source,
and added it to the stereo projector.</p>

<p>Thor-na'thor listened politely while Frost explained the generator's
working and use, and at the end shook his head once more. "No. I am
sorry, there is no secret. No." He nodded good-by to both of them, and
started toward the airlock.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Scott shouted after him. And then, when he turned, "take the
projector with you!"</p>

<p>"But—"</p>

<p>"It's okay. We want you to have it. It's a gift."</p>

<p>When Thor-na'thor, holding the projector carefully between his hands,
had departed, Frost turned on Scott.</p>

<p>"What the heck did you do that for?" he demanded. "Are you crazy? He
wanted that projector; it's possible we might have been able to make a
deal with him after all."</p>

<p>"You know we wouldn't. And—oh, he made me feel so cussed small when
he said that about having thought it was a gift. I could've hidden
underneath one of those little blue Martian geckos. And besides, the
old buzzard's pretty decent. Likeable."</p>

<p>"Hunh! You'd better get into a different frame of mind before tonight,
then. Maybe I'd better try it by myself."</p>

<p>"No. I'll back you up."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Scott whispered to Frost, "Funny sort of library. People go in and
people come out, but none of them is carrying anything. Of course, it
could be the books don't circulate."</p>

<p>"It could be Thor-na'thor was lying, you mean." Frost whispered back.
"It's not a library, it's the place where the Vardians go for their
shots or what. Thor-na'thor must think we're awful fools."</p>

<p>Scott made no reply. He was shivering. The nights on Vardia in this
latitude had a penetrating chill, and they had been waiting behind the
gelid marble of the monument for Thor-na'thor for several hours. The
Vardians were addicted to routine, but Scott was beginning to wonder
if something had prevented their official host from taking his regular
evening stroll. Scott wished he had worn a heated suit.</p>

<p>"I think—" Frost said at last. "Yes, here he comes. And he's by
himself."</p>

<p>As the Vardian moved past the base of the monument to Trj Doteon, the
two earth-men fell in on either side of him.</p>

<p>"We've got you centered," Frost said into the Vardian's ear.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" Thor-na'thor answered placidly.</p>

<p>"Go with us to the ship."</p>

<p>When they were inside the <i>Alceste's</i> cabin again, Frost said,
"You forced this on us. I hope you'll decide to be reasonable. Do you
know what a sliver gun is?"</p>

<p>"I have not that honor," Thor-na'thor replied. His expression was
peculiar; whatever it expressed, he did not appear to be alarmed.</p>

<p>Still centering the Vardian in his bolter, Frost got out a sliver gun
from a locker and pointed it at the Vardian.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="figcenter illowp83" id="illus" style="max-width: 34.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption">Frost got out a sliver gun from a locker and pointed it
at Thor-na'thor.</div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>"Little but mighty," he said. "Thor-na'thor, this is it. Being shot by
a sliver gun is rarely fatal, unless you're hit in a nerve center. But
a wound from it produces tonic spasms of all the voluntary muscles. I
was shot by one once; I'd rather have a major burn without anesthesia.</p>

<p>"Scott, hold out his hand."</p>

<p>Scott locked the Vardian's wrist in a tight grip and held the member
out to Frost.</p>

<p>"Now," Frost said. "Why don't you Vardians die?"</p>

<p>Thor-na'thor laughed. "Torture, my boy?" he said. "It is too bad, I am
afraid I shall look ridiculous. But there is no secret. You are too
young to understand."</p>

<p>Frost drew a deep breath. His finger wavered on the lever of the sliver
gun. Then he tossed the gun down on the cover of the locker and turned
bitterly on his heel.</p>

<p>Scott released the Vardian's wrist. "As I thought," he said. "You'd
better go, Thor-na'thor. I imagine we'll be starting back to Terra in a
few hours."</p>

<p>"So soon?" the Vardian asked courteously. "We Vardians should like an
opportunity to say farewell properly to our guests."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. I wish—"</p>

<p>"Would you like me to give you the projector back? You do not need to
be ashamed; it is a very valuable thing."</p>

<p>"No, not that. I was wishing that the all-earth Central Committee would
decide to send a commission to Vardia to investigate this business
about Vardians never dying. But it's impossible; the committee has a
great respect for local autonomy."</p>

<p>Handshakes, at Thor-na'thor's request, were exchanged. Their parting
was friendly. As the <i>Alceste</i> took off on the first leg of the
long return, Frost said: "I wonder what it was?"</p>

<p>Scott shook his head. "There might have been something. But we'll never
know."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thor-na'thor walked up the broad low steps of the library. He tipped
back his head to look at the inscription over the big door; it was in
the long-obsolete non-phonetic Vardian script, but he knew what it said.</p>

<p>At the threshold an attendant smiled at him and held out a basin for
him to wash his hands. The attendants knew him well by sight, since his
visits to the library always exceeded the daily minimum prescribed by
law; Thor-na'thor was a pious man.</p>

<p>When he was clean, he passed into the enormous adytum. He paused at the
entrance to enjoy the deep pleasure which the sight of the vast room
always roused in him.</p>

<p>From ceiling to floor it was lined with books; the biographies,
lovingly, piously compiled, of every man, woman and child who had
ever lived on Vardia since the enormously distant time when the art
of writing had come to the race. Two balconies zoned the room, and
everywhere were reading desks.</p>

<p>Thor-na'thor approached one of the librarians. He walked slowly, for he
was thinking of what he had read above the door, "No one who ever lived
deserves to die," and feeling for the thousandth time its deep truth.</p>

<p>The librarian greeted him courteously. "Will you have one of your
friends," she asked, "or shall it be a stranger?"</p>

<p>"A stranger," Thor-na'thor replied without hesitation. It was
considered far more pious to peruse a stranger's life than that of one
of one's friends.</p>

<p>She went to a shelf, handed him a book. "No one has had this for a long
time."</p>

<p>Thor-na'thor went over with it to a reading desk. He opened it,
savoring to the full his grateful task of rescuing from oblivion one of
the honored Vardian dead.</p>

<p>"Habor-binhabor," he read in the second chapter, "was inordinately
fond of the old-fashioned game of matzor. On the ninth of Satatius,
20034, he stayed up until after midnight playing it, and on another
occasion."</p>

<p>Thor-na'thor closed the volume over his forefinger. How strange the
earth people were, he thought, how violent, how crude, how young!
Heartless, too—witness how they had let their comrade Kynaston
die utterly. There had been not the slightest attempt to write his
biography. Perhaps, as their race grew older, they would learn that
the whole purpose of man on earth is to keep alive the memory of
the honored dead. Perhaps they would learn then that no one who is
remembered ever dies.</p>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
